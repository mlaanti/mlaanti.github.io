            On the left you can see one of my two chihuahuas, Ressu. I've had him and his littermate, Rambo, for about three years. They were originally my sister's dogs, but due to circumstances, they came to stay with me a while before Covid started, and have been staying with me ever since. They're both very sweet and silly boys, and are going to turn ten-years-old this coming January.
