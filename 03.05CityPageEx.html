            Osaka is Japan's second largest city, located in the Kansai region. As a harbour city, it was historically considered Japan's economical center and has been a hub of commerce, food culture and entertainment ever since.

            When I was seventeen, I spent a year as an exchange student in Osaka and ever since, it's had quite a special place in my heart. I have visited it twice since, and hope to make another trip within the next few years.

            Osaka-ji (Osaka Castle) is one of the many sights one should definitely see if visiting. The picture featured is courtesy of <a href="https://www.pexels.com/@satoshi/">Satoshi Hirayama</a>.
